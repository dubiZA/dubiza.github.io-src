Hi, I'm Darius. This is my space on the bit world wide web. I hope you enjoy it. By workday, I'm a SecOps Team Lead/Cloud Security Engineer. The rest of the time, I'm a husband, father, and tech enthusiast.

The content on this site is where I chronicle my learning and share any projects I have been working on in the world of AWS, Python Cybersecurity, and anything else I dabble in that should probably be documented.
