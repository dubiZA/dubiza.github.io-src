Over the last few days I have been trying to figure out how I want to go about chronicling my... accomplishments? I figured, if I'm going to spend time learning something, I should also invest some time documenting what I have learned for three reasons (in no particular order):

- So that I don't have to find all the sources out there on the web that lead to success all over again
- With the hopes that it proves useful to someone out there in comming days
- The stuff I've worked on stays in my head as a result of "writing it down" so to speak

Setting up this site with GitHub Pages using Pelican (the Python based static site generator) and fronting it with Cloudflare's free tier CDN was enough of a challenge that it seems like a fantastic place to start writing. So, let's get started!

# Resources I Used
I followed two guides to get this to work:

- [Fedora Magazine][3] has a pretty solid write up that helped the most in figuring things out

- [Tom Ordonez's][4] blog is where I found the Fedora Magazine reference and the idea to configure the GitHub Pages site with Cloudflare as CDN
